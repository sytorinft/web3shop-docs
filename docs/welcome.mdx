## What is Web3Shop?
Web3shop is the first blockchain-native e-commerce platform that aims to solve the customization of fashion for billions of people. 

Users will together with designers to co-create the unique fashion that never existed in the past world before and fully give back the design copyright to the users.

Our first step is to support custom fashion based on specific NFT collections, and will expand to more NFT collections, brands and communities in subsequent iterations.

## Why we need Web3Shop?

### Data Ownership
In Web3 data transformation, data ownership and identity autonomy will return from the big platforms to the users. Web3shop as the first blockchain-based e-commerce platform helps every user, designer, and shop owner get back the value that belongs to them. Every shop is a smart contract running on the blockchain, and each design is an NFT. We give the ownership of the fashion design and the ownership of the shop back to the user completely. At the same time,  open and transparent on-chain data can help users record the complete chain of each goods, copyright, value distribution, and carbon footprint etc.

### Co-creation Economy
The core value of commodities is content, but the current content of commodities is far from meeting the need for personalized displays. In order to have more variety and high quality content, we need to involve more small creation nodes to form a closed-loop value co-creation economy.

Web3shop brings users, designers, and manufacturers together to create unique products in the world. Designers and users act as the first level of innovation, creating unique designs through co-creation and keeping the core value of design content and copyright in NFT. The manufacturer does the second level of innovation, they get the design NFT and then use the process and innovative production technology to produce items from the world that did not exist before.

The design-production separation model based on the web3shop innovation inspires and liberates the role of each participant, facilitating more creative nodes joining and thus leads to more innovative content.

### Asset-based algorithms
Web3shop improves the information-gathering-based recommendation algorithm in the past by making greater 
use of the user's open and transparent on-chain assets and returning newly generated data value to the user.
